        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p> 
       I bring a background in technical recruiting and a strong commitment to transitioning into the software development field. My journey includes completing a rigorous 10-week full-stack coding BootCamp at Mind-Mingle, where I mastered JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS within the ReactJS/NextJS framework for web application development. I also gained proficiency in Express for building RESTful/backend APIs, utilized PRISMA for database management, Zod for form validation, Jest for testing our code, and Git for working together on a codebase. 
      </p> 
<p>
  During the BootCamp, I actively collaborated on group projects and developed a portfolio project to showcase my skills and capabilities. Additionally, I'm actively immersing myself in the Dutch culture by dedicating time to learning Dutch through a government-sponsored NL training program.
</p>
        
      <p>
        I am now eager to apply my newfound skills and knowledge to real-world challenges and projects. I am actively seeking job opportunities where I can contribute meaningfully and continue to grow as a software developer.
